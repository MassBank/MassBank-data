PUBLICATION: Mori K, Akasaka K. Pheromone synthesis. Part 256: Synthesis of the four stereoisomers of 5,11-dimethylpentacosane, a new sex pheromone component of the male Galleria mellonella (L.), with high stereochemical purities as determined by the derivatization-HPLC analysis of the eight stereoisomers of 5,11-dimethyl-8-pentacosanol. Tetrahedron. 2015 Jun 17;71(24):4102-15. doi: 10.10.1016/j.tet2015.04.107.
COMMENT: JMS-T100GCV is a reflectron TOF (reTOF) MS. Temperature of the ion source and GC-transfer line was 250 C. Resolving power (FWHM, nominal) was 7,000.
COMMENT: Field ionization (FI) voltage, which is defined as the voltage between the emitter surface and the electrode, was 10 kV (default). Typical accuracy level expected was 10 ppm. Postrun m/z adjustment was made at a known mass, 130.1358.
COMMENT: This record was created by the financial support of MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16HP2005 to the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan.
