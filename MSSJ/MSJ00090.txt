COMMENT: The detection sensitivity of benzene was determined by data at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 ppb(v/v). A ten-VOC premixed standard gas containing methanol, acetonitrile, acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, benzene, methylvinylketone, toluene, p-xylene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was used for the determination of the detection sensitivity.
COMMENT: The reactant ion, NO+, was generated from the air at the hollow cathode discharge 2.0 mA by using Proton Transfer Reaction plus Switchable Reagent Ion Mass Spectrometry, PTR+SRI-MS.
COMMENT: Pressure inside of the drift tube was 2.1 mbar. Temperature of the drift tube was 105 C. Electric field of the drift tube was E/N = 67 Td (U_drift = 250 V). Temperature of inlet tube was 105 C.
COMMENT: This record was created by the financial support of MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16HP2005 to the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan.
