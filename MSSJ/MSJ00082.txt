COMMENT: One micro litter of the liquid sample was dropped in a 10 mL glass vial. The vial was placed under the DART ion source.
COMMENT: Direct analysis in real time (DART) is a method of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). Protons, H+, generated by glow discharge ionization of the He gas in the ionization chamber, DART-SVP (IonSense Inc., MA, USA), were major reactant ions for the chemical ionization of samples.
COMMENT: The interface introducing the product ions to the mass spectrometer was Vapur Interface (AMR. Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The pressure in the interface was 710 Torr (96.3 kPa).
COMMENT: 1 mg of azulene was placed on glass capillary. The capillary was placed in the gas flow that ran from the ion source.
COMMENT: Azulene was purchased from TCI A0634.
COMMENT: This record was created by the financial support of MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16HP2005 to the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan.
