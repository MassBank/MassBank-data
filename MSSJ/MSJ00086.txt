COMMENT: Sample concentration was 1.73 ppm (v/v), produced by using a Permeator.
COMMENT: The reactant ion, NO+, was generated from the air at the hollow cathode discharge 2.0 mA by using Proton Transfer Reaction plus Switchable Reagent Ion Mass Spectrometry, PTR+SRI-MS.
COMMENT: Pressure inside of the drift tube was 2.1 mbar. Temperature of the drift tube was 105 C. Electric field of the drift tube was E/N = 67 Td (U_drift = 250 V). Temperature of inlet tube was 105 C.
COMMENT: This record was created by the financial support of MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 16HP2005 to the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan.
