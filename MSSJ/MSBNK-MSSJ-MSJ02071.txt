COMMENT: JMS-T100GCV is a reflectron time-of-flight (reTOF) mass spectrometer. Temperature of the ion-source and GC-transfer line were 60  and 200 C. Resolving power (FWHM, nominal) was 7,000.
COMMENT: Field ionization (FI) voltage, which is defined as the voltage between the emitter surface and the electrode, was 10 kV (default). Typical accuracy level expected was 10 ppm. Postrun m/z adjustment was made at a known mass, 126.1045.
COMMENT: This record was created by the financial support of MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21HP8020 to the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan.
